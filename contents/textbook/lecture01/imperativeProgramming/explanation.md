What we will be introduced in CS2030 is the concept of **Imperative Programming**. 
What we have learnt in CS1010J / CS1010S / CS1101S is the usage of **Functional Programming**, which is a form of **Declarative Programming**. 

Here some differences we can see in **Imperative Programming Vs. Functional Programming**. 

| Imperative | Functional | 
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Performing tasks and Changing program state | Information and Transformations to be required | 
| Mainly manipulated using classes and structures | Mainly manipulated using functions and data |
| Order of execution is important | Order of execution is not that important | 

A key difference to note is that in imperative programs, Each assignment updates or changes the value of a variable, 
allowing variable names to refer to different values at different points within the program itself. <br /> 
Whereas in functional programs. Each function call should return a new value, 
and that value can be used again as an argument for another function call. Mutation of variables usually does not exit here.<sup>1</sup>
