# Instructions for TAs

## Approving PRs
1. Review student's pull request and ensure that content is relevant and the right files are modified under "Files Changed". The right directory should be `/contents` and not `/_site`.
2. Check for formatting (WIP).
3. If required, leave comments to ask student to fix certain issues. 
4. Merge pull request!

## Formatting Standard

(WIP)

## Enabling Navigation
(Aiming to script this process eventually)
1. Clone the repo to your local computer.
2. In the student's markdown, ensure that the Navbar, heading and edit links are included. E.g.:
    ```markdown
    <frontmatter>
    pageNav: 2
    header: header.md
    footer: footer.md
    siteNav: site-nav.md
    </frontmatter>
